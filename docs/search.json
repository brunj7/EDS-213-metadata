When possible relies on API to programmatically download the necessary data sets\nPreserve your data products on the KNB repository, including developing the necessary metadata to make them reusable\nDocument and Make your code available\nThe most important part of the project is to go through those steps. Having a conclusion or a specific answer to your scientific question at the end of the project is secondary. The evaluation will be focused on the steps followed and how reusable your work will be.\nProject Presentation\nPrepare a 6 slides / 10min Presentation\nYou should address:\nThe question you are trying to answer\nData Management plan, including who did what\nHow you got the data (API, …) & merge it\nSome cool results you got\nWhere is your work Preserved:\nData package on KNB including data set(s) produced and code(s)\nGitHub Repository with a well documented README\n\nProject Example\nI will take the example of the LTER Luquillo stream chemistry dataset that we used for the group project of EDS-214.\nAn example of project question based on this data could be: Do hurricanes have an significant impact on stream chemistry and how variable is this response across the US? The data sets to merge could be the one we used for Luquillo combined with other LTER sites, such as Florida Coastal Everglades, or USGS stream data along hurricane tracks.\nActually, there was a recent LTER synthesis working group which looked at patterns in stream chemistry: https://lternet.edu/working-groups/stream-energy-nutrient-cycling/\nGroup Projects\n(in order of presentation)\nGroup 8: Clarissa Boyajian, Alex Vand, and Scout Leonard – How do population demographic factors impact lead exposure in Philadelphia?\nPresentation: https://scoutcleonard.github.io/eds213_group8/group8_presentation.html\nCode: https://github.com/scoutcleonard/eds213_group8\nData: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Ad7c29133-7858-4880-bb59-be07d1cdd038\n\nGroup 4: Cullen Molitor, Desik Somasundaram, Julia Parish, Ryan Munnikhuis – What is the effect of sea surface temperature on coral bleaching?\nPresentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UDMZihPIA2xYxqNjcoOsaR8Iv2Cf3F53TRkVYCVqRdM/edit#slide=id.p\nCode: https://github.com/desik23/eds-213-group-project\nData: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn:uuid:f8930217-24e9-4d1a-95a7-c64b8b6ea64d\n\nGroup “San Clemmies”: Paloma Cartwright, Mia Forsline, Daniel Kerstan, and Wylie Hampson – What is the abundance and impact of zebra mussel populations in US freshwater lakes?\nPresentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18JdNrYsCUYXICQ1DeLwZRl_Xt-I1IdD-nI5Kyy6TGyQ/edit#slide=id.p\nCode: https://github.com/palomacartwright/EDS213_SanClemmies\nData: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Ad662d417-1adf-4914-a55a-e8808d50ab70\n\nGroup 1 / “Teamnado”: Peter Menzies, Shale Hunter, Alex Clippinger, and Charles Hendrickson – What are the effects of tornadoes on key water quality parameters?\nPresentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16w0pr4vpWU33M6gnKU7Kc6pmiAt5FHSQvx3lot6qt_I/edit#slide=id.p\nCode: https://github.com/petermenzies/tornado-effects-on-water-quality-parameters\nData: https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/view/urn%3Auuid%3A65290f76-2737-473e-94ac-6e71ecb77284 & https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/view/urn%3Auuid%3A251f2c8f-3f10-4d0a-8842-3e386b1264ae\n\nGroup 2: Jake Eisaguirre, Juliet Cohen, Grace Lewin, and Connor Flynn – How does wind speed affect sea surface temperature and chlorophyll in our local Santa Barbara Channel?\nPresentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I8jAoIU_Qa1LQbCexdXcK8UybUn83wKSIvMQZZfk6bY/edit#slide=id.p\nCode: https://github.com/ConnorFlynn/EDS213_group_proj\nData: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Ab9273004-1948-468a-93e7-d89a156bd172\n\nGroup 7: Steven Cognac, Felicia Cruz, and Joe Decesaro – How have harmful algal blooms changed since 2011 at the Scripps Pier?\nPresentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p2oq-BFBPnbWuWOpSdYbpZGje0pwzl7HdFOTe0tVq8o/edit#slide=id.p\nCode: https://github.com/joedecesaro/EDS213_group7_project\nData: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3A59b5a00a-f9a5-46f9-b3aa-ccf8c4ddbd27\n\nGroup 3: Halina Do-Linh, Allie Cole, and Marie Rivers – How MPA’s affect sea otter populations\nPresentation: https://marierivers.github.io/EDS_213_group_project/EDS_213_group_presentation.html\nCode: https://github.com/marierivers/EDS_213_group_project/blob/main/README.md\nData: https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/view/urn%3Auuid%3A0d85a131-e471-4019-ba1a-e34eb9ed1ef2\n\nProject Teams Random Suggestion\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(DT)\n\n# Set the random seed to make this reproducible\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Read the roster \nstudents <- read.csv(\"data/eds213_roster.csv\")\n\n# Randomly create the groups\nstudents %>% \n  slice(sample(1:n())) %>%   #

We will practice how to download data from data repositories both manually and programmatically relying on APIs. We will also discuss how to track the provenance of data, generate metadata integrating data semantics to increase data discovery, as well as archiving data products on data repositories to make them available to the broader community.\nLearning objectives\nRe-use data from others leveraging data repositories and metadata standards\nRely on APIs to programmatically access and download data\nUnderstand concept of metadata, data semantics and data preservation and why it matters in our path towards reproducible and open science.v\nCurriculum\nEDS 213 is a half Fall quarter course (2 units) running from Monday 2021-09-27 to Wednesday 2021-10-27.

Let’s start our week by searching some data on the data repository DateONE: https://search.dataone.org/data\nIn case you need some inspiration, look at this dataset about historic precipitation in Alaska: https://doi.org/10.5063/N29VCQ\n\nThe programmatic way\nAlthough discovering data through a web interface is convenient and offers a great experience, it is often hard to scale this approach or to integrate it into a reproducible workflow.\nSlides\nWednesday 10/06/2021 – Using APIs Lab\nUSGS dataRetrieval R package to retrieve hydrological data\nUSGS is managing a vast network of gauges to monitor freshwater across the US.\nExercise 1\nStart a new Markdown document to plot the discharge time-series for the Ventura River from 2019-10-01 to 2020-10-05\nWebpage: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11118500\nTutorial for the package can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html#daily-data\nBonus\nHow would you try to determine when this stream gauge record started using the API?\nmetajam\nThe metajam R package relies on the dataONE API to download data and metadata into your R Environment. It is currently supporting KNB, ADC and EDI repositories because they rely on the metadata standard EML.\nShort intro to the package\nExercise 2\nLet’s determine what percentage of Alaskan household are speaking only English!\nThe data: https://doi.org/10.5063/F1N58JPP\nRead the metadata\nDownload the data household_language.csv using metajam\nRead the data into R using metajam\nWrite a piece of code that will compute the percentage of Alaskan household speaking only English for the year 2009 to 2015\nCreate a plot to visualize this data\nBonus\nHow does it compare to French?\n\n\n\n",

Since we are not archiving a real data set, we will be using the developer site of the KNB: https://dev.nceas.ucsb.edu/data\nTo be able to upload a dataset, you will need to first create an ORCID: https://orcid.org/\nAs pair:\nDownload the data set: https://aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu/~brun/ntl_airtemp_sample.csv\nClick on the “Submit” button on the KNB\n\n\n\nFill up the form as much as you can about the general metadata\n\n\n\nAdd the csv file and click on describe to add the specific metadata\n\n\n\nIf you need inspiration, here is the original dataset the data sample was taken from: https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/e3ff85971d817e9898bb8a83fb4c3a8b\nWorking on your group project\n\n\n\n",
