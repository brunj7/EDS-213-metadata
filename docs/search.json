I think most of them are most useful when you’re trying to make a finalized table with data in it, but if you really want to beautify your website tables there are options.\n\n\n\n",

For example, to link to UCSB’s home page that would look like:\n  Learn more about [UCSB](https://www.ucsb.edu/).\n  \nWhich when built looks like this:\nLearn more about UCSB.\n\n\n\n",

Here, only using Google fonts is described (there are other methods for downloading fonts and adding, not included here).\nFonts are imported and specified in theme.css\nIn your Project in RStudio, open the theme.css file.\nNear the top, you’ll see some lines that look like this:\n/* Header font */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sanchez&display=swap');\n\n/* Body font */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Nunito+Sans:wght@300;400&display=swap');\n\n/* Code font (Roboto Mono) */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto+Mono:wght@300;400&display=swap');\nThose are the import command to get 3 different Google fonts (Sanchez, Nunito Sans, and Roboto Mono). You can explore many different Google fonts here.\nUse different fonts\nFind a Google Font you like.\nClick on the font. To the right of the font example text, you should see an option to ‘+ Select this style’. Click the one(s) you want to select.\nThat will probably bring up a side menu. If you don’t see that side menu, you can see your selected styles at any time by clicking on the top-right menu icon that is a grid with 3 squares and a plus sign - hovering reveals this is to ‘View your selected families’. In the Use on the web section of the side menu that appears, select the radio button for @import. It’ll look weird like this (for the Zen Dots Google Font):\n    <style>\n    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Zen+Dots&display=swap');\n    <\/style> \nCopy everything BETWEEN (but excluding) the ending <style> and <\/style>tags\nPaste the @import line you’ve copied into the top section of theme.css near the other fonts imported there. It is now available for use in your theme.\nUpdate the css with your new fonts, replacing the existing font names with the name you’ve imported. You might want to use a Find & Replace All if you want to make sure you’re updating a font everywhere it appears in the current theme.\nRepeat for as many different fonts as you want to update in your theme.\n\n\n\n",
