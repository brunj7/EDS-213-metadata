## Group Project Goal

The goal of the group project is to practice the re-use of data for a [synthesis project](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach) merging different datasets to get new insights, as well as preserving your scientific products on a data repository. 


## Project Development

You will have to:

1. Define an environmental scientific question you would like to answer
2. Search [dataONE](https://search.dataone.org/data), [Google datasets](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) and other data repositories (https://www.re3data.org/) to find data to try to answer this question
3. Develop a Data Management Plan for your project, including keeping track of the provenance (sources) of your data and who will be in charge of what.
4. Develop a scripted  workflow to conduct your analysis. When possible relies on API to programmatically download the necessary data sets
5. Preserve your data products on the [KNB](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/) repository,  including developing the necessary metadata to make them reusable
6. Document and Make your code available

**The most important part of the project is to go through those steps**. Having a conclusion or a specific answer to your scientific question at the end of the project is secondary. The evaluation will be focused on the steps followed and how reusable your work will be.


## Project Example

I will take the example of the LTER Luquillo stream chemistry dataset that we used for the [group project of EDS-214](https://brunj7.github.io/EDS-214-analytical-workflows/group_project.html). 

An example of project question based on this data could be: _Do hurricanes have an significant impact on stream chemistry and how variable is this response across the US?_  The data sets to merge could be the one we used for Luquillo combined with other LTER sites, such as [Florida Coastal Everglades](https://lternet.edu/site/florida-coastal-everglades-lter/), or [USGS stream data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) along hurricane tracks.

Actually, there was a recent LTER synthesis working group which looked at patterns in stream chemistry: https://lternet.edu/working-groups/stream-energy-nutrient-cycling/
