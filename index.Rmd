## Course description

This course will cover the concept of metadata and how it can be leveraged for the integration of heterogeneous datasets into standardized data products. We will practice how to download data from data repositories both manually and programmatically relying on APIs. We will also discuss how to track the provenance of data, generate metadata integrating data semantics to increase data discovery, as well as archiving data products on data repositories to make them available to the broader community.


## Learning objectives

- Re-use data from others leveraging data repositories and metadata standards

- Rely on APIs to programmatically access and download data 

- Understand concept of metadata, data semantics and data preservation and why it matters in our path towards reproducible and open science.v


## Curriculum 

EDS 213 is a half Fall quarter course (2 units) running from Monday 2021-09-27 to Wednesday 2021-10-27. The course is developed around two main themes:

- Re-using data from others
- Preserving your data
