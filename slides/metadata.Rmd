# What is Metadata?

- WHO created the data?

- WHAT is the content of the data?

- WHEN were the data collected?

- WHERE are the data from?

- HOW were the data developed?

- WHY were the data developed?

# What is Metadata important

### Metadata are important for the short and long-term utility of data


---

# Who uses metadata?

```{r, out.width="70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/metadata_users.png")
```

---

# Metadata for data Re-user

- Find relevant data

- Evaluate what is suitable for use in your work
- Retrieve the data you’ve found
- Understand if and how to actually use the data


---

# Metadata for data producers

- Avoid data duplication
   - What data have already been collected? 
   - Save time the next time
   - Hey, I’ve already done this!
   
- Share reliable information
   - What methods were used
   - How data were collected
   
- Publicize your work 
   - Citation
   - Credits

# Metadata for organizations

- Help ensure the organization’s investment in the data
   - Ability to use data after initial intended purpose
   - Track data re-use and citation 

- Transcend people and time
   - Data are not lost when researchers or labs leave
   - Avoid duplication in new work 

- Advertise organization’s research
   - What data has our organization produced?

# Metadata Standards

### A metadata standard provides a uniform structure to describe data:

- Machine readable (e.g. XML)

- Common terminology

- Common structure

---

# Standard examples

- [Dublin Core](https://dublincore.org/) (emphasis on publications)

- [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/) (emphasis on collections)

- [FGDC](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata) (emphasis on spatial data and gov. data)

- [ISO19115](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) (emphasis on spatial data and services)

- [Ecological Metadata Language, EML](https://nceas.github.io/eml/) (emphasis on table attributes and taxonomy)
